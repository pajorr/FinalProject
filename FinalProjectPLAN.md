FinalProject :

8bit Piano/Beep Piano

8bit piano would use playsound function. (Playing mp3s with commands)
Beep piano would use the beep command.

Both pianos are interactable and are not hardcoded.

Next update would be me, choosing which piano that i will create based on the difficulty of each.
